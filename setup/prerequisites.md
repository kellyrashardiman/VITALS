To follow along during the workshop, or to run through the notebooks contained within the repository using the Openscapes 2i2c Cloud JupyterHub (cloud workspace), the following are required. All software or accounts are free.

1. **Earthdata Login account**  
    - Create an Earthdata Login account (if you don't already have one) at <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/users/new>

You will receive an email invitation to join the organization on GitHub. You must join to gain access to the workspace.  
3. **Netrc file**
    - This file is needed to access NASA Earthdata assets from a scripting environment like Python.

For this workshop, `earthaccess` package is used to automatically create a netrc file using your Earthdata login credentials if one does not exist. There are detailed instruction available for creating a .netrc file using other methods [here](https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/2022-Fall-ECOSTRESS-Cloud-Workshop/how-tos/authentication/NASA_Earthdata_Authentication.html).
